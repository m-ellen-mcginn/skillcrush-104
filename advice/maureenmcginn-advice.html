			<h4>Tip 1: Practice!</h4>
			<p> You won’t get anywhere if you just sit on your ass and lament that you suck at coding. Asides from following tutorials, you should work on your own projects.</p>

			<p>“The most fundamental thing is that you actually go and code,” says Andrei Thorp from Evernote. “I’ve heard it recommended that by the time you finish college, you should have written 100,000 lines at minimum.”</p>

			<h4>Tip 2: Be Patient</h4>
			<p>No-brainer here, but beginners often wind up frustrated by their lack of progress and forget that they’re not alone.</p>

			<p>“Becoming a good programmer takes a long, long time and a lot of tedious evenings,” says Mike Arpaia, a former Etsy dev who now builds information security software for Facebook. Mike stresses that beginners should give up on the assumption that one can become an excellent developer quickly. “Before you can write good code, you have to write hundreds of thousands of lines.”</p>
